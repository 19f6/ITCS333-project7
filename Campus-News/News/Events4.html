        The University of Bahrain, in cooperation with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), organized a workshop titled “Quantum computing for sustainable development”, which was attended by a number of members of the University of Bahrain, heads, deans, faculty and students interested in the field.

        Mr. Martin Gastal, CERN Advisor for MENA Region presented an overview of CERN, the CMS muon detector experiment and a summary of the Open Quantum Institute (OQI). A new three-year program of CERN, focusing on selected sustainable development goals, use cases to explore quantum computing applications in areas such as health, energy, climate action, clean water and food security.

        Mr. Abdulla Ebrahim Subah, Research and Teaching Assistant at the College of Information Technology, introduced quantum computing, a multidisciplinary field encompassing aspects of computer science, physics and mathematics that use quantum mechanics to solve complex problems more quickly than traditional computers.

        The workshop, moderated by Mr. Martin Gastal, featured quantum computing case studies where participants collaborated in groups to explore its applications for sustainable development. Teams generated ideas related to UN Sustainable Development Goals, including clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), life below water (Goal 14), affordable and clean energy (Goal 7), and climate action (Goal 13). The workshop concluded with participants presenting and exchanging ideas, and the proposed projects will be showcased on CERN’s Open Quantum Institute platform.
